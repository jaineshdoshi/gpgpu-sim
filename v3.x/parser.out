Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . sentence
    (1) sentence -> . WORD EQUALS VALUE
    (2) sentence -> . WORD EQUALS NUMBER
    (3) sentence -> . WORD EQUALS NOTHING

    WORD            shift and go to state 1

    sentence                       shift and go to state 2

state 1

    (1) sentence -> WORD . EQUALS VALUE
    (2) sentence -> WORD . EQUALS NUMBER
    (3) sentence -> WORD . EQUALS NOTHING

    EQUALS          shift and go to state 3


state 2

    (0) S' -> sentence .



state 3

    (1) sentence -> WORD EQUALS . VALUE
    (2) sentence -> WORD EQUALS . NUMBER
    (3) sentence -> WORD EQUALS . NOTHING

    VALUE           shift and go to state 5
    NUMBER          shift and go to state 6
    NOTHING         shift and go to state 4


state 4

    (3) sentence -> WORD EQUALS NOTHING .

    $end            reduce using rule 3 (sentence -> WORD EQUALS NOTHING .)


state 5

    (1) sentence -> WORD EQUALS VALUE .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (sentence -> WORD EQUALS VALUE .)


state 6

    (2) sentence -> WORD EQUALS NUMBER .

    $end            reduce using rule 2 (sentence -> WORD EQUALS NUMBER .)
